        "content": "A 43-year-old woman and her two daughters are among five persons who were injured after the roof of the house collapsed when an LPG cylinder exploded at a house at Abdullapuram village on the outskirts of Vellore town on Saturday.\n\nPolice said that the injured persons were identified as A. Shakila (43), her two daughters namely A. Jayabharathi (25) and A. Jayapriya (24), and two repair service personnel from a private LPG gas agency such as K. Vithesh (18) and S. Vijayakumar (31).\n\nInitial inquiry revealed that K. Aarivalagan (48), a wage labourer, was living with his wife Shakila and two daughters in the house at Abdullapuram village. It was around 9 p.m when Shakila was unable to switch on the LPG cylinder in the kitchen. He informed the private gas agency, which sent two staff to attend to the fault.\n\nBy the time the repair service personnel reached the house, Shakila was making dinner at the veranda of the house, using firewood. Along with Shakila and two daughters, the service personnel went to the kitchen and tried to move the cylinder. The cylinder exploded, engulfing the entire house in flames. In the impact, the roof of the house collapsed.\n\nAfter hearing a huge noise in the house, neighbours rushed to the spot and rescued injured persons, who got caught in the rubble. They also informed Virinjipuram police and fire fighters from Vellore town. Injured persons were admitted at Vellore Government Medical College Hospital, where their condition is said to be stable. Collector V.R. Subbulaxmi met the injured persons at the hospital. A case was registered. A probe is underway.",

        "content": "A tall solitary chinar tree fails to provide a canopy to dozens of people of all ages waiting outside the Jammu and Kashmir (J&K) Traffic Police’s two-storey building in Srinagar’s Polo View area. There is the buzz of drivers, some agitating and some pleading, all united in asking for their vehicles back. A pick-up truck pulls up, with a full load of seized two-wheelers from nearby locations. Tow-trucks bring in four-wheelers.\n\nThe traffic department’s compound is full of vehicles, parked bumper to bumper. With 100-odd people crowding the compound and the 50 or so cars and bikes, only a senior officer’s vehicle can negotiate the drive into the compound now. Official data says that over 1,000 two-wheelers and four-wheelers have been seized by the traffic department just this week. All were from underage drivers across Srinagar.\n\nThis unprecedented crackdown was triggered by the death of two Class 11 students in an accident caught on surveillance cameras. The clip shows the boys speeding in a sports utility vehicle, attempting to overtake another car, and then hitting a parked truck. The vehicle turned turtle and the video has disturbing details of what happened thereafter.\n\nOn November 15, a day after the tragic accident, millions had viewed the clip on social media in the first 24 hours after it was posted.\n\nThe bypass, where the incident took place, is an outer ring road that connects Srinagar with Jammu on one side and Baramulla on the other. The viral video, which shook the Valley, sparked a debate on a range of new issues confronting a society that was once known for its strict, conservative upbringing of children.\n\nThe Regional Transport Office (RTO), Srinagar, has cancelled 619 driving licenses, penalised 1,600 violators, and imposed fines amounting to ₹2.22 lakh across the city, after the accident. But beyond the administrative crackdown, the deaths of these two children have thrown up discussions around unplanned urbanisation, parenting, and school discipline in Srinagar.\n\nCar counselling\n\nMuzaffar Ahmad Shah, Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP), Srinagar, says parents are often permissive with their children, but social media is also a trigger when it comes to rash driving. Two months ago, the traffic police had counselled the parents of one of the victims of the Tengpora Bypass accident, when he had been caught driving the car. At least 15-20 parents are counselled in such cases every month in Srinagar, officials say.\n\n“We counselled the parents of a boy recently who posted a video of driving at 182 km/hour in Srinagar at night. We tracked down the driver who was a teen from an educated family. He could have killed many in a mishap,” says Shah.\n\nOne of the parents counselled by the traffic department admits they and their partner allow their children to drive the car once in a while. “We both work, and spend long hours in the office. After school, the children go to coaching centres and insist on driving themselves. The accident, however, has shaken us. We have decided against allowing our son to drive a car again,” they say, on the condition of anonymity.\n\nThe police also monitor online accounts that promote stunts, and have seized many vehicles in such cases.There are also complaints of teens driving towards Jammu and Delhi without the consent of their parents. In one such case, a group of schoolboys was tracked down and detained after they planned to drive to Jammu, 300 kilometres away from Srinagar, to celebrate a friend’s birthday.\n\nFacts and figures\n\nMagistrates in several districts in the Kashmir valley have issued circulars banning the sale of petrol and diesel to minors. “Any fuel station found violating this order will face suspension or revocation of the license to operate the fuel station,” the circular issued by the Shopian district magistrate reads. Scores of petrol pumps across the Valley have started putting up banners, denying fuel to minors.\n\nJammu and Kashmir sees far more deaths in road accidents than militant violence. While the collective number of militants and civilians killed every year does not go beyond 250, the roads are a far greater danger zone. In 2012 the State recorded 6,709 road accidents, which left 1,165 people dead and 9,755 injured, as per traffic department statistics.\n\nDespite improved car technology and road expansion, including widened national highways and new bypasses, J&K has recorded 4,990 accidents this year so far, which has left 703 dead and 6,820 injured. J&K’s summer capital, Srinagar, saw 476 accidents last year, which left 55 dead and 493 injured. This year so far, Srinagar has recorded 394 accidents, which has left 50 dead and 411 injured.\n\n“Unfortunately, a pattern emerging in Srinagar is that the victims of accidents are mostly pedestrians. An almost 40% fatality rate is higher than the national average,” Shah says. The growing violation of traffic rules is also evident from the number of challans across the State. According to official figures, over 12 lakh challans have been imposed in J&K this year so far. Srinagar has seen the highest, with 3.37 lakh.\n\nOfficial figures suggest that Srinagar has 5 lakh registered vehicles and sees a major inflow of tourist vehicles and inter-district traffic on a daily basis. Many experts feel road infrastructure in Srinagar city is not commensurate with the volume of traffic.\n\nClamping down administratively\n\nFacing a public outcry, the Srinagar administration is engaging representatives of coaching centres and private schools to bring about a behavioural change. “Parent-teacher collaboration, regular interactions between parents, teachers, and coaching centre representatives will be held to ensure that students receive consistent guidance both at home and in educational settings,” says Bilal Mohi-Ud-Din Bhat, Deputy Commissioner, Srinagar.\n\nA dedicated task force comprising representatives from the administration, educational institutions, coaching centres, and civil society has been set up in Srinagar to oversee the implementation of safety and awareness initiatives.\n\nA parent, whose son, a Class 10 student, met with an accident earlier this year in Srinagar’s old city, says, “My son has a broken arm and has developed a limp. This is going to impact him all his life now. We need to put in place measures that ensure children, who can’t rationalise the impact of rash driving, are not allowed to drive and risk their lives.”\n\nSchools across the valley are putting in place new rules to ensure students don’t drive to school. G.N. Var, president of the Private Schools Association of Jammu & Kashmir, says the recent accident was a wake-up call. “We are aware that schools have a larger responsibility. The influence of teachers and schools on students is unmatched and we will be leveraging this position to make our society safer,” Var says.\n\nThe association will push for awareness programmes and organising workshops on campuses to educate students about the dangers of underage driving and the legal implications involved. “Parent-teacher meetings will also discuss driving habits and traffic violations. Schools will use these platforms to discuss the responsibilities of parents and emphasize that parents not allow minors access to vehicles,” Var adds.\n\nThe schools are mulling implementing a new vehicle policy. “The policy will prohibit students from driving to school unless they are of legal age and possess a valid driver’s license. This could include penalties for violations,” an Association member says.\n\nSocial activation\n\nHakim Sameer Hamdani is the design director of the conservation organisation, Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage, Kashmir. He says most accidents take place on newer stretches of road, not in the old city, where the roads are narrow and there are no long, open stretches that are conducive to speeding. “In the old city, besides formal policing, society also plays the role of policing to monitor rash driving.”\n\nKashmir’s clergy is seeing underage driving as a societal problem. “No minor student operating any motor vehicle, including a two-wheeler or four-wheeler, will be allowed entry into a religious place,” says Imran Ansari, the president of the All J&K Shia Association. He has directed all madrasas, mosques, and Imam Barghas under its umbrella “to exercise strict vigilance”.\n\nThe Doctors Association Kashmir (DAK), a body of doctors in Srinagar, has also demanded measures to contain accidents in Kashmir. “We are witnessing a worrying surge in trauma cases at local hospitals, with youth disproportionately affected. Many of these accidents result in severe injuries, including traumatic brain injuries, spinal cord damage, and complex fractures,” says Dr. Mohd Yusuf Tak, president of the DAK. He adds that tragically, many lives are lost. Of those who survive, many end up with injuries that take months of rehabilitation, to heal.",

        "content": "A Chinese man who was fired for taking a quick nap after working late has sued his former employer and been awarded 350,000 yuan (Rs 41.6 lakh) in compensation. Mr Zhang had served as a department manager at a chemical company in Taixing, Jiangsu province, for more than 20 years. His dismissal came earlier this year after surveillance footage showed him napping at his desk, following a work-related drive that extended until midnight the night before, SCMP reported.\n\nTwo weeks after the incident, the company's human resources (HR) department issued a report, saying that Mr Zhang had been “caught sleeping at work due to exhaustion,” a document Mr Zhang signed. In an online conversation, an HR staff member asked, “How long did you nap that day?” Mr Zhang responded, “About an hour or so.”\n\nAfter consulting with the labour union, the company issued a formal dismissal notice, claiming Mr Zhang's behaviour was a violation of the company's strict zero-tolerance discipline policy.\n\n\"Comrade Zhang, you joined the company in 2004 and signed an open-ended employment contract. However, your behaviour of sleeping on the job is a serious breach of the company's zero-tolerance discipline policy. Consequently, with the union's approval, the company has decided to terminate your employment, ending all labour relations between you and the company,\" the notice read.\n\nMr Zhang believed his dismissal was unjust and decided to take legal action against the company. In its evaluation, the court acknowledged that while employers have the right to terminate contracts for regulatory violations, such actions must meet certain conditions, such as causing significant loss to the company.\n\n\"Sleeping on the job was a first-time offence and did not result in serious harm to the company,\" explained Judge Ju Qi from the Taixing People's Court. Considering Mr Zhang's two decades of outstanding service, promotions, and salary increases, the court determined that firing him over a single infraction was excessive and unreasonable.\n\nThe court ultimately ruled in favour of Mr Zhang, ordering the company to pay him Rs 41.6 lakh in compensation.",

        "content": "The mandate that Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) had managed to get in Maharashtra during the parliament elections has been lost in the assembly elections. Not many were willing to say which way the election would turn this time. There was almost an agreement among political analysts and pollsters that the election was too close to call. But now it's clear that much before the election, the voters had decided to vote for Mahayuti.\n\nIt is not an ordinary mandate. It is the best-ever performance by the BJP-led alliance.\n\nIn 2014, the BJP contested alone and won 122 seats, but in 2019, it contested along with Shiv Sena and had 161 seats together, whereas the Congress-led alliance had to satisfy itself with only 98 seats. This time, Mahayuti has more than 2/3 seats in its kitty. The BJP, Shiv Sena, and NCP all performed better than expected. Now the question is, why has the MVA, which won 30 out of 48 seats in the parliamentary elections, failed so miserably in the assembly elections?\n\nIn Jharkhand, on the other hand, INDIA Bloc has managed to regain people's confidence. This is a stupendous success considering the fact that Chief Minister Hemant Soren was jailed just before the general elections and was behind bars for six months. Once he was out, his trusted colleague Champai Soren deserted the party just before the assembly elections. Still, the JMM-led alliance is heading for a big win, unlike most state has seen before.\n\nTwo verdicts from two distant states tell a story: there is no uniform outcome and no single narrative. However, it can be said that women voters played a significant role in both states, and in each, direct cash transfers to women's accounts proved decisive. In Maharashtra, the female voter turnout rose by 2.5% compared to the 2019 assembly elections, in contrast to male voters. In Maharashtra, the Ladki Bahin Scheme, and in Jharkhand, the Maiya Samman Yojna, both benefited the ruling coalitions.\n\nAnother noticeable pattern in both states is that those who won the Lok Sabha election were unable to replicate that performance in the assembly elections. In both states, the Lok Sabha results were reversed in the assembly elections. In Maharashtra, the MVA outperformed the Mahayuti in the parliamentary elections, but in the assembly elections, the Mahayuti reversed the trend. In Jharkhand, the NDA won 9 out of 14 Lok Sabha seats, but in the assembly elections, it was the INDIA alliance that defeated the NDA. This clearly underlines that Lok Sabha and assembly elections are fought on different issues and platforms, and it is erroneous to predict assembly election results based on Lok Sabha outcomes, or vice versa.\n\nMaharashtra election is another example that Congress-led INDIA is not willing to learn any lesson. After the Parliament election, it was expected that Congress in Haryana and MVA in Maharashtra would have easy wins. But in both states, the BJP-led coalition belied all the expectations, and one can say with confidence that the Congress-led alliance has mastered the art of snatching defeat from the jaws of victory. Let's not forget that in December 2023, Congress was expected to win MP and Chhattisgarh assembly elections. Whereas when no political pundit was willing to give a chance to the BJP in these two states, it turned the tables and came back with flying colours.\n\nSimilarly, the Congress was unable to win the Uttarakhand and Punjab assembly elections in 2022. Therefore, both INDIA bloc and, particularly, the Congress need to reflect and develop a winning strategy. I'm not denying that Congress had successes in Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, and Telangana, but the issue remains: why lose a state that could have been easily won, and why is it that the BJP managed to turn a losing situation into a victory?\n\nThe Maharashtra election results could have far-reaching consequences, particularly for Shiv Sena (UBT) and NCP (SP). Operation Lotus had already split Shiv Sena and NCP, and the Lok Sabha election delivered a significant blow, not only to Narendra Modi at the centre but also to Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena and Ajit Pawar-led NCP. Despite receiving recognition from the Election Commission, had both parties lost in the assembly elections, their existence would have been seriously jeopardized. Now, the reverse scenario is possible. The Modi government at the centre and the BJP-led Mahayuti government in the state, with a mandate of more than two-thirds, will likely try to weaken both parties, aiming to claim sole ownership of the original Shiv Sena and NCP. Given the results, Sharad Pawar and Uddhav Thackeray will find it difficult to retain their MPs. Even the BJP may attempt to poach their MPs by engineering further splits in the parliamentary wings of both parties. If that happens, the BJP at the centre will edge closer to the majority mark in the Lok Sabha. Even if not, MLAs who have won on Uddhav Thackeray and Sharad Pawar's party tickets could be lured to join the treasury benches.\n\nI know it is too early to write the last chapter of Sharad Pawar's biography, but it is also true that Sharad Pawar, who emerged as a hero in the Parliament election, is now a tragic figure. He has lost after having made an emotional appeal to voters that it was his last election. Sharad Pawar is already 84 years and it is expecting too much for him to remain relevant in 2029 when the next assembly election will be held.\n\nOn the other hand, Uddhav Thackeray is much younger, but it must be noted that in both the Lok Sabha and assembly elections, Shinde proved to be better equipped to carry forward Balasaheb Thackeray's legacy. Uddhav's performance has been more than disappointing. He and his son, Aditya, will find it very difficult to mount a comeback. Blaming EVMs is poor politics. It makes no sense to blame the EVMs, insinuate any wrongdoing in the election, or propagate the idea that the electoral process has been manipulated unless there is concrete proof.\n\nFinally, on the role of the RSS going forward. It was said that the RSS was less active during the 2024 general election and that was behind the BJP's below-par performance. Does this mean the RSS's role in the BJP's affairs will now be more decisive?\n\n(Ashutosh is the author of 'Hindu Rashtra' and co-founder of SatyaHindi.com)\n\nDisclaimer: These are the personal opinions of the author",

        "content": "A survey team at Shahi Jama Masjid in Sambhal, Uttar Pradesh, witnessed stone pelting while conducting a survey of the mosque amid heavy police deployment on Sunday, November 24, morning.Police had to use tear gas to control the situation in the area.This was the second survey being conducted at the Mughal-era mosque. As many as 10 people have been detained and a probe was launched into the violence, an official said, adding that some people even tried to set fire to some motorcycles parked on the roadside.Tension has been brewing in Sambhal over the past few days after the Jama Masjid was surveyed last Tuesday on the orders of a local court following a petition that claimed that a Harihar temple stood at the site.According to the local administration, a second survey by an \"Advocate Commissioner\" as part of a court-ordered examination into the disputed site started around 7 am and a crowd began gathering there.\"Some miscreants in the crowd pelted stones at the police team. The police used minor force and tear gas to bring the situation under control,\" Superintendent of Police Krishna Kumar Vishnoi said.He said those who engaged in stone pelting and those who incited them will be identified and action will be taken against them.District Magistrate Rajendra Pesia said, \"Some miscreants resorted to stone pelting but the situation is peaceful now and the survey is underway.\" \"Around 10 people have been detained in connection with the stone-pelting incident. They are being interrogated,\" he added.Uttar Pradesh police chief Prashant Kumar said that the situation was under control in Sambhal.\"We are monitoring everything. All police and civil administration officials are handling the situation on the spot. They are patrolling those areas. Anti-social elements will be identified very soon and strict action will be taken against them,\" the director general of police (DGP) said.Videos of youths throwing stones at police, purportedly near the site of the survey in Sambhal have surfaced on the Internet.Supreme Court lawyer Vishnu Shankar Jain, who is a petitioner in the case, had said the Court of Civil Judge (Senior Division) ordered the constitution of an \"Advocate Commission\" to survey the mosque.The court has said that a report should be filed after conducting a videography and photography survey through the commission, he had said.The Central and Uttar Pradesh governments, the mosque committee and the district magistrate of Sambhal have been made parties in the petition concerning the mosque, Jain said last Tuesday.Vishnu Shankar Jain and his father Hari Shankar Jain have represented the Hindu side in many cases related to places of worship, including the Gyanvapi Mosque-Kashi Vishwanath temple dispute.Gopal Sharma, a local lawyer for the Hindu side, told PTI on Friday that in his petition filed in the court, he mentioned that \"Baburnama\" and the \"Ain-e-Akbari\" has confirmed that a Harihar temple was at the site where the Jama Masjid now stands.He also claimed that the temple was demolished by Mughal Emperor Babur in 1529.Samajwadi Party (SP) MP Zia Ur Rehman Barq had objected to the developments.\"The Jama Masjid of Sambhal is historical and very old. The Supreme Court had given the order in 1991 that whatever religious places are there in whatever condition since 1947, they will remain at their places,\" he had said.The next date for hearing in this case is January 29.",

        "content": "India, projected to house 350 million children by 2050, must navigate critical challenges like extreme climate and environmental hazards to ensure their well-being and rights, according to a new UNICEF report.It underlined that although India will see a decline of 106 million children compared to today, it will still account for 15% of the global child population, sharing this responsibility with China, Nigeria, and Pakistan.UNICEF's flagship State of the World's Children 2024 report, The Future of Children in a Changing World, was launched in New Delhi on Wednesday (November 20), spotlighting three global megatrends, demographic shifts, climate crises, and frontier technologies that are set to reshape the lives of children by 2050.The report was unveiled by Cynthia McCaffrey, UNICEF India Representative, alongside Suruchi Bhadwal of The Energy Research Institute (TERI), UNICEF Youth Advocate Kartik Verma.The report pointed out that by the 2050s, children will face dramatically increased exposure to extreme climate and environmental hazards and nearly eight times more children are expected to be exposed to extreme heatwaves compared to the 2000s.This escalation of the climate and environmental crisis is compounded by the fact that more children will be living in today's interpretation of lower-income countries, particularly in Africa, where resources to tackle these challenges may be limited without significant, strategic investments.The report underscored that India, projected to house 350 million children by 2050, must navigate critical challenges to ensure their well-being and rights. Although India will see a decline of 106 million children compared to today, it will still account for 15% of the global child population, sharing this responsibility with China, Nigeria, and Pakistan.\"Decisions made today will shape the world our children inherit,\" said McCaffrey. \"Placing children and their rights at the centre of strategies and policies is essential for building a prosperous, sustainable future,\" she said.With nearly one billion children worldwide already exposed to high-risk climate hazards, India ranks 26th in the Children's Climate Risk Index.Indian children face acute risks from extreme heat, floods, and air pollution, particularly in rural and low-income communities.The report predicts climate crises will disproportionately impact their health, education, and access to essential resources like water.Bhadwal emphasised the urgent need for climate action: \"Children are vulnerable to direct and indirect impacts of climate change. as active agents of change, we can address these challenges collectively.\" Frontier technologies, including artificial intelligence, hold promise and peril for children.However, the digital divide remains stark, with only 26% of people in low-income countries connected to the internet, compared to over 95% in high-income countries.The report called for inclusive technological advancements to bridge this gap and ensure safe, equitable access for children.The report outlines the need for India to prioritise investments in health, education, skilling, and sustainable urban infrastructure.Nearly half of India's population is projected to live in urban areas by 2050, necessitating child-friendly and climate-resilient urban planning.Kartik Verma, who represented UNICEF India at COP29, highlighted the importance of climate education: \"Climate change is a child rights crisis. Empowering children with knowledge and tools can make them part of the solution.\" The report's launch coincided with World Children's Day, marked by illuminating iconic monuments across India, including Rashtrapati Bhavan, India Gate, and Qutub Minar, in UNICEF's signature blue.The GoBlue campaign reinforced the importance of inclusion, equality, and non-discrimination for every child.",

The devastating blaze started in the Special Newborn Care Unit (SNCU) around 11 pm on Friday, resulting in the deaths of 10 infants at the scene.As investigations continue, questions are being raised about the safety standards and administrative lapses at the medical college, which has been mired in controversies for several years.Despite being one of the prominent healthcare institutions in the region, the college has faced repeated allegations of mismanagement, substandard facilities, and inadequate staffing.One of the most pressing issues is the lack of permanent leadership at the medical college. Both the principal, Dr. Narendra Singh Sengar, and the Chief Medical Superintendent (CMS), Dr. Sachin Mahor, are holding acting positions. The absence of permanent officers has delayed addressing critical administrative and infrastructural deficiencies. This, critics argue, has contributed to the unsafe conditions at the medical college.Over the years, several incidents have raised alarms about the quality of care at the institution. During the COVID-19 pandemic, reports emerged that staff at the college were administering diluted medications to patients, putting lives at risk. Other incidents, such as rats chewing on corpses in the mortuary and disturbing videos of stray dogs eating human remains, have further tarnished the college's reputation.The recent fire has brought the medical college back into the spotlight, sparking public outrage and demands for accountability. An investigation committee has been set up to probe the cause of the fire and assess the safety measures at the medical college.",

        "content": "Kuldeep, a resident of Mahoba in Uttar Pradesh, saved three children from the fire that engulfed the infant ward of a medical college in Jhansi on Friday night but was left in the dark about the fate of his own newborn.At least 16 children are battling for their lives while 10 newborns died after a massive fire, allegedly caused by a short circuit, broke out in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) of Maharani Laxmi Bai Medical College around 10:45 pm.Kuldeep’s son was born just 10 days ago and had been admitted to the Jhansi hospital for a routine check-up. While he and his wife waited in the lobby for the doctors, the blaze suddenly erupted in the ward.He rushed to the area and rescued three children, burning his hand in the action. However, Kuldeep remained anxiously waiting for an update about the condition of his own child, unsure whether he was alive or not. Meanwhile, his wife was devastated, unable to stop her tears.The visuals from the scene showed panic-stricken patients and their caretakers, with a large number of police personnel assisting in the rescue and relief efforts. A woman who lost her child shared that she couldn’t find her baby after the incident and was later informed that the child had died.During the challenging time, several other parents also displayed remarkable alertness and acted selflessly to save the newborns. One such story is that of Mangal Singh.Singh, whose newborn son was charred to death, rescued many children after the massive fire broke out at the hospital’s infant ward. Around 54 newborns were admitted to the ward at that moment as the officials too swung into action and rescued 44 newborns.Kripal Singh Rajput, whose grandson was admitted to the hospital, said the fire erupted suddenly when he reached the hospital around 10 pm on Friday night.Upon entering the infant ward, he saw six children on a single bed. There were 18 beds in the ward, he said, raising concern about the treatment of 54 children in a limited space.In a courageous act, he rescued 25 newborns, though he said that many of them sustained severe injuries from the massive fire.A senior police official informed that 16 children who suffered injuries during the incident are being given treatment at a local hospital and efforts have been stepped up to save them.“All doctors are available for them, along with adequate medical facilities,\" said Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Jhansi Sudha SinghUttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, who ordered a high-level probe into the incident and sought a report by Saturday evening, announced a compensation of Rs 5 lakh each to the families of the deceased children and Rs 50,000 each for the injured.His deputy, Brajesh Pathak, also inspected Jhansi Medical College on Saturday morning and ordered a probe into the incident. He said action would be taken against those found guilty of negligence.“A high-level inquiry will be conducted into this incident and if any negligence is found at any level, action will be taken against it,\" he said in an X post.Taking cognisance of the fire incident at the Jhansi hospital, Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed deep anguish over the death of 10 children.“Heartbreaking!

        "content": "Six people died in a horrific car crash earlier this week in Uttarakhand's capital Dehradun. The group of seven was returning from a party in a Toyota Innova when it rammed a truck at around 1.30 am on November 12 at the ONGC Chowk. The impact turned their vehicle into a mangled heap of metal, killing six of them on the spot. The seventh friend survived but is in a critical condition.A disturbing video showing the aftermath of the accident is doing the rounds on social media. The collision decapitated a victim, while several body parts of others were seen strewn across the road. One body was seen twisted inside the car.Kunal Kukreja (23), Atul Agrawal (24), Rishabh Jain (24), Navya Goel (23), Kamakshi (20), and Guneet (19) died in the accident. Sidhesh Agrawal (25) survived and is currently in the hospital. All of them, other than Kukreja, were residents of Dehradun.Sidhesh threw the party to celebrate the purchase of his new car, reports said.“Since the MUV’s driver, who owned the vehicle, did not survive, we are looking into legal alternatives as no charges can be filed posthumously,” Inspector K.C. Bhatt from Cantt police station was quoted as saying by the media.He noted that speeding was the primary cause of the accident, according to early findings. The car was going at a speed of 100 kmph, before it hit the truck.As per a report by The Times Of India, CCTV footage shows the accident happened when the Innova tried to overtake a luxury car and increased its speed. The car had no licence plate. It took a sharp acceleration at the ONGC Chowk, before striking the left rear of the truck.Videos of the victims drinking at a party before the accident have also gone viral but they have not been verified yet.",

        "content": "With air quality plunging into the 'severe' category on Thursday, the Delhi government is stepping up pollution control measures under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) Stage II.Environment Minister Gopal Rai announced a series of heightened enforcement actions aimed at curbing rising pollution levels. The Air Quality Index (AQI) touched 428 at 9 am , marking one of the worst readings in the country this season.Under Stage II of GRAP, the Delhi-National Capital Region (NCR) faces stringent restrictions. The use of coal and firewood is now banned in commercial settings, while diesel generator sets are restricted except for essential services like hospitals and emergency operations.The minister attributed the drastic spike in pollution to stagnant weather conditions, including low wind speeds and a drop in temperature, which he said had trapped pollutants over the city.While the AQI had already reached severe levels on Wednesday, Rai indicated that implementing GRAP Stage III was unnecessary, as forecasts predict slight improvements beginning Friday.During a press briefing, Rai highlighted the multifaceted sources of Delhi's pollution. Studies show that 30% of pollutants stem from within the city, while 34% are attributed to emissions from the broader National Capital Region.“The Delhi government will strengthen all ongoing campaigns to mitigate pollution under GRAP II,” Rai assured, noting that these efforts are crucial to preventing further escalation into emergency levels.Rai also announced plans to review and enhance all existing pollution control initiatives. This will include intensified enforcement efforts, ensuring adherence to emission norms, and coordinating with neighbouring regions to manage transboundary pollution.(With inputs from PTI)",
